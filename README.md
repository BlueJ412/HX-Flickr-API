# HX-Flickr-API
HX Task (Flickr API) for Full Stack Developer, Software Engineer Vacancy

Flickr Task completed with some notes.
Description Array was created and not used as description only ever seems to include a second post of the photo along with links to the photo and author's page.
This didn't seem to add anything to the post and made the page look untidy so it was ommitted from the final app.

This was my first attempt at a task such as this since I left University in July 2015 and went straight into a teaching career.  As such I have little real world experience that I can draw from as well as little continued development on my programming skills due to putting my time into training to teach.
Most of this project was self-taught and all of the code is either written by myself exclusively or adapted from examples found online to fit in with what I was working on.

I look forward to updating this in the future as I gain more experience and learn how to add more advanced features into this project.
